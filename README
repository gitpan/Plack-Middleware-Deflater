NAME
    Plack::Middleware::Deflater - Compress response body with Gzip or
    Deflate

SYNOPSIS
      enable "Deflater";

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Middleware::Deflater is a middleware to encode your response body
    in gzip or deflate, based on "Accept-Encoding" HTTP request header. It
    would save the bandwidth a little bit but should increase the Plack
    server load, so ideally you should handle this on the frontend reverse
    proxy servers.

    This middleware removes "Content-Length" and streams encoded content,
    which means the server should support HTTP/1.1 chunked response or
    downgrade to HTTP/1.0 and closes the connection.
